## Some Introductions are in Order...

Hi! My name is Josh Dewhurst, and I am a People Operations Business Partner with a strong focus on people analytics, HR strategy, and employee development. I am located in San Francisco, CA, and I am passionate about using data-driven approaches to improve HR processes, enhance employee experiences, and drive organizational success.

### My Experience and Career Trajectory

**Current Role: People Operations Business Partner at San Francisco AIDS Foundation**  
In my current role, I have developed and implemented a comprehensive Compensation Philosophy that reduced our deficit budget by 33% over five years and addressed equity concerns with performance-based annual salary increases. I orchestrated an overhaul of the onboarding process, increasing overall retention rates by 22% and POC community retention by 35%. Additionally, I managed employee relations for over 300 employees, defended against wrongful termination cases, and centralized incident reporting across the organization.

### Key Projects

**Workplace Violence Prevention Plan**  
Achieved full compliance with Senate Bill 553 by developing and implementing a comprehensive prevention plan. Built a specialized incident reporting platform, identifying and addressing 7 incidents in the first 2 weeks. Created and coded the training program from scratch using HTML and embedded CSS.

**People Analytics - Equity**  
Led an equity analysis project to evaluate company demographics, identifying significant concerns in leadership diversity. Used Microsoft Suite (VLOOKUP, Pivot Tables) to generate custom reports, informing more equitable advancement processes. Presented findings to the board, driving enhanced diversity and inclusion initiatives.

**Python Machine Learning - Employee Churn**  
Developed a predictive model using decision trees, neural networks, gradient boosting, random forests, and logistic regression to identify employees at risk of churning. The modeling identified underlying factors contributing to employee churn, leading to targeted interventions. Implemented strategies based on model findings, resulting in an 8% reduction in churn across the organization. The linked GitHub repository provides an overview of the code used to identify these trends; due to confidentiality, the exact code cannot be shared.
